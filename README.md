```
Relay your fears some are long
founded
With a side to you that stays
so near
Open eyes won't solve it
Be the soul of discretion act
your years
Southern climbs rise higher but
tastes so near
Take your time a look with fire
seems insincere
Southern climbs rise higher
Don't freeze up somewhat
excited
We've planned these moments
inside out
Open eyes won't solve it
Be the soul of discretion
outside in
Southern climbs rise higher but
tastes so near
Take your time a look with fire
seems insincere
Southern climbs rise higher but
tastes so near
Take your time a look with fire
seems insincere
Tastes so near
Tastes so near
Southern climbs rise higher
